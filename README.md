# Learn Python with Projects - Text Encrypter/Decrypter

A simple and modern GUI application built with PySide6 for encrypting and decrypting text using various algorithms. This project is meant for beginners.


## Description

This application is a demonstration project designed to teach Python, PySide6, and related concepts to students. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using a variety of methods and features a clean and intuitive Material Design interface.

## Features

*   Modern GUI built with PySide6
*   Material Design theme
*   Multiple encryption algorithms (DemoEncrypt, Caesar Cypher, ASCII, HASH, SHA256)
*   Customizable input dialog for Caesar Cypher sliding
*   Clear and readable output

## Files Included

*   `main.py`: The main Python file containing the GUI application code.
*   `README.md`: This file, providing information about the application.
*   `requirements.txt`: A list of the required dependencies to install using pip.
     (pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt)

## Usage

1.  Run `main.py` to start the application. (python.exe main.py)
2.  Select an encryption algorithm from the dropdown menu.
3.  Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt in the input field.
4.  Click the "Encrypt Text" or "Decrypt Text" button.
5.  If decryption requires a key, a popup box will appear asking for the key.
